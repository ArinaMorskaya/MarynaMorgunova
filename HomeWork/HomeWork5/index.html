    <h1>Alice in Wonderland</h1>
    <h3>Character description of Alice</h3>
    <p>Alice is the main character of the story “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” and the sequel “Through the Looking-Glass and
    what Alice found there”.    
    She is a seven-year-old English girl (in ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’ she is exactly seven years old, in ‘Through
    the Looking-Glass’ she is seven and a half) with lots of imagination and is fond of showing off her knowledge. Alice is
    polite, well raised and interested in others, although she sometimes makes the wrong remarks and upsets the creatures in
    Wonderland. She is easily put off by abruptness and rudeness of others.    
    In Through the Looking-Glass, she is 6 months older and more sure of her identity.</p>    
    <p>The character of Alice is based on a real girl, called Alice Liddell, who was one of the author’s child-friends.
    Alice by Lewis CarrollThe illustrations of Alice by John Tenniel are not based on Alice Liddell. Carroll sent Tenniel a
    photograph of Mary Hilton Badcock, another child-friend, who was the daughter of the Dean of Ripon. He recommended her
    as a model, but whether Tenniel accepted this advice remains a matter of dispute. The name of one of the three little sisters in the Treacle Well refers to Alice: ‘Lacie’ is a transformation of the
    letters from the word ‘Alice’.</p>
    <h3>Alice in Wonderland quotes</h3>
    <span>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
    “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
    “I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
    “Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
    “–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
    “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”</span>
    <span>‘I could tell you my adventures–beginning from this morning,’ said Alice a little timidly: ‘but it’s no use going back
    to yesterday, because I was a different person then.’</span>
